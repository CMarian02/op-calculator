<h1 align = "center"> A Simple Calculator </h1>
<p> [⚠️] A simplistic calculator that can only operate two numbers, the choice was made because I was trying to change the Tkinter library to PyQt5 and this project was rushed.<br>
[🧮] The calculator can operate by add, minus, multiply, divide, mode operators.You can delete the whole equation via the 'AC' button, and a single character via the 'CC' button (this function only deletes the number you are at, if you create number one you can delete it, instead an operator or after choosing it you can't go back to delete number one, the 'AC' button is used)<br>
<h3 align = "center">[👷🏽]The known issues are:[👷🏽]</h3>
<p> [⭕] - If a number is written, for example 0,00001, it is displayed in full only after pressing the '1' button.<br>
[☢️] - After it starts creating the number '1' if you press equal it resets the error, it's not really an error, I chose to leave it that way for now.<br>
[🎲] - Various display problems with overly large numbers, which is why they were limited.

<h3 align= "center">[✨]The project is considered completed.[✨]</h3>
<p>[📌] I will probably come back with a project on the same topic, a calculator, created with the PyQt5 library and with a much better defined and more logical code structure.</p>
